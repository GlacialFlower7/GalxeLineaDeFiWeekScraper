This script is a naive attempt to estimate the load on Linea blockchain. The idea is, that when the *growth rate* of the total number of participants (read from Galxe) 
declines, the gas would start to fall and you can do your tasks!
I know that the 8th out 9 week is a bit too late for this tool but still :D
# Setup

The `galxe.py` script does the job, the Jupyter notebook helps visualizing the data. Check out the already acquired data in `out.tab`
## Dependencies:
